# ELS Siren Cutout (FiveM)  
  
## Introduction: ##  
ELS Siren Cutout is a simple script to prevent leaving a siren on when exiting a vehicle with ELS on FiveM/FivePD servers. As there is no way to easily see if the ELS siren is active, it works by recognising when you are about to exit an emergency vehicle with Stage 3 lighting on (Code 3) and toggles the stage three lighting twice (turning it off and on again).
